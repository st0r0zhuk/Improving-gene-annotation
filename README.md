- Yamls to reproduce creating lift over chain files [Script folder](CAGE/)
- Script to do reciprocal lift over to get CAGE peaks for all species [Script file](CAGE/LiftOver_CAGE.Rmd)
- Snakemake files and config to run pipeline at different isoform support levels (s1,s2,s3) [Scripts folder](Snakemake_to_reconstruct_isoforms/)
- Scripts for explorative analysis of the discovered isoforms [Scripts file](Scripts_for_analysis_of_isoforms/plot_overall_isoform_statistics.Rmd)
- Scripts to add SQANTI3-filtered isoforms supported by at least 2 long reads from Mandalorion to the default gtf per species [Scripts folder](Scripts_for_merging_gtfs_and_qc/)
