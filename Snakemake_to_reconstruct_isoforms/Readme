# Snakemake pipeline to process R2C2 reads

Three snakefiles are provided, each runs the pipeline with distinct discovery/support threshold (minimal number of long reads needed to retain an isoform)
- Snakefile with support threshold 1 [Here](/Snakemake_to_reconstruct_isoforms/Snakefile_s1)
- Snakefile with support threshold 2 [Here](/Snakemake_to_reconstruct_isoforms/Snakefile_s2)
- Snakefile with support threshold 3 [Here](/Snakemake_to_reconstruct_isoforms/Snakefile_s3)
